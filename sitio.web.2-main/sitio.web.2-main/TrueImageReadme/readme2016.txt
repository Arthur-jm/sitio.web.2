1) download True Image 2016:
http://dl.acronis.com/s/AcronisTrueImage2016.exe

2) disconnect internet!

3) install True Image, start it and use one of these keys
XTSLAH7A-T7BQZMVA-AZN85T47-MV5PQS29-NWPBLM9M-ENDN2VA4-8ZF7WEGA-XQ78Y8CN
Q2SVQXWX-8DQNQD9X-GF6XUEQW-NCTPMR94-VMSQT8YB-775TCCUP-FQ43Z5WP-NLJVDH6S

4) wait a few seconds, then terminate True Image

5) run ActivatorAcronisTIH.exe
   if you read "activation successful!" everything is ok

6) reconnect internet and have fun...


if you need the manual:
http://dl2.acronis.com/u/pdf/ATI2016_userguide_en-US.pdf

Media Add-on (for PE boot cd -> read the manual):
http://dl.acronis.com/s/AcronisTrueImage2016_addons.exe
since version 19.0.0.6559 it is already included in main setup!


if you need the regular boot cd only:
http://dl.acronis.com/s/AcronisTrueImage2016.iso

here you find the new, promised to be always current
dl2.acronis.com/s/AcronisUniversalRestore.iso
use it after restoring on dissimilar hardware

(create an usb-stick with XBOOT or YUMI)



annoying popup "You don't have a license for Acronis True Image!"
close all programs, set date one year in advance
close upcoming popup, correct date


If True Image is asking for activation after 30 days:
click "OFFLINE ACTIVATION" and type any activation code, e.g. 1234
(the patched "libcrypto10.dll" accepts all)


If you experience problems: (Hardware ID has changed) run setup.exe again and "repair"
Then run ActivatorAcronisTIH.exe again

If that doesn't help: uninstall, reboot, then run the Acronis cleaner
